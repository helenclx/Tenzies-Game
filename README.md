# Tenzies Game

![](./screenshot.png)

Roll until all dice are the same.

## Build Information

Built with Vite + React.

Cased on the Tenzies game tutorial from Scrimba's [Learn React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). However, I have made enhancements to the code to improve the app, including:

- Put real dots on the dice using CSS
- Use relative units in CSS
- Make the app responsive to different screen sizes
- Added dice roll count
