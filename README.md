Roll until all dice are the same.

## Build Information

Built with Vite + React.

Based on the Tenzies game tutorial from Scrimba's [Learn React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). However, I have made enhancements to the code to improve the app, including:

- Putting real dots on the dice using CSS
- Using relative units in CSS
- Making the app responsive to different screen sizes
- Adding dice roll count
- Recording the number of dice rolls and the time it took to win
- Tracking the best records of dice rolls and time taken to win
